//Third approch 
// [4,3,1,5] -> arrange it in ascending order -> [1,3,4,5]
//then access first element of array

//step 1 -> check if first element is greater than the second one
//is 4 < 3 ? -> yes -> swap them
// [3,4,,1,5]
// now still campare 0th element of array with the next 2nd element

// 3 > 1 ? -> yes -> swap them
//[1,3,4,5]
